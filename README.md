# Software I Final Project (JavaFX Application)

Final Project for Western Governors University class "Software I"

My Second Object Oriented Programming Project (written in Java)

Evaluator Comments:
 - "Java skill is shown in the inventory application with proper class structure and inheritance. The Main class launches the app successfully. The buttons effectively invoke the methods for control of the Part and Products. The interface is user-friendly and the exception handling is effective. Part dependency and price relationships are enforced well. Good job on the deletion confirmation prompts. Additional feedback is provided within the rubric. Well done on the GUI and Java skills for the assessment."

Task:
 - You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. They have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.
They have provided you with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the system (see the attached “GUI Mock-Up”) and a class diagram to assist you in your work (see the attached “UML Class Diagram”). The organization also has specific business requirements that must be included as part of the application. A system analyst from your company created the solution statements outlined in the requirements section based on the manufacturing organization’s business requirements. You will use these solution statements to develop your application.


Overall Course Competencies:
 - Classes and Interfaces
    - The graduate designs software solutions with appropriate classes, objects, methods, and interfaces to achieve specific goals.
 - Object-Oriented Principles
    - The graduate implements object-oriented design principles (e.g., inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction) in developing applications for ensuring the application’s scalability.
 - Application Development
    - The graduate produces applications using Java programming language constructs to meet business requirements.
 - Exception Handling
    - The graduate incorporates simple exception handling in application development for improving user experience and application stability.
 - User Interface Development
    - The graduate develops user interfaces to meet project requirements.
